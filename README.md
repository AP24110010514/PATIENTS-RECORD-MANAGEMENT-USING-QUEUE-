# PATIENTS-RECORD-MANAGEMENT-USING-QUEUE-
This project is a Hospital Patient Queue Management System built in C++. It uses the queue data structure to manage patient flow efficiently in a hospital setting. The system allows hospital staff to add patients, serve them in order, search for a patient by ID, count how many patients are waiting, and display all patients currently in the queue.
